DESCRIPTION OF FUNCTION simple_shell :

    Command reading: The shell reads commands entered by the user, usually from a command line interface (CLI) or script.
    Command parsing: commands are parsed to identify individual elements such as commands, arguments, operators and so on.
    Command interpretation: The shell interprets commands and determines the actions to be performed. This may include program execution, file manipulation, I/O redirection, etc.
    Command execution: Once interpreted, commands are executed in the system environment. The shell creates processes to execute the corresponding programs or actions.
    Error handling: The shell handles possible errors, such as non-existent commands, permission problems, syntax errors, etc.
    Return of execution: After executing commands, the shell can return information on the result of the operation, such as exit codes to indicate whether the command was executed successfully or encountered problems.
